The gnomes weren't alone under the Aurora bridge.  A number of pesky larger trolls also lurked about in the gnomes backyard.  The problem with the trolls was that they were hungry creatures.  And while humans made for reliable carb loading for the trolls, what they really had a taste for was a plump little gnome.  This meant that the gnomes had to keep on their toes as to avoid being eaten by the trolls.  And the gnomes had an upside in their fight against the trolls.  They were faster and nimbler.  Trolls are slow and slothily creatures.  A gnome can quickly out maneauver a troll.  However, gnomes are easily distracted and can very easily be all consumed by whatever it is they do.  This unfortunately allows for the trolls to be easily able to sneak up on an unsuspecting gnome.
