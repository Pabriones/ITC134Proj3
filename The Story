Once upon a time in the land of now.  there were three gnomes that lived under the Aurora bridge.  Dickey, Michelle, and Fifel were their names.  They liked to bake pies, going swimming in lake Union, and pulling innocent pranks on people cruising the Burke-Gilman trail.  
One of thier favorite pranks was to line the pavement of the Burke-Gilman trail with small nails for the cyclists.
