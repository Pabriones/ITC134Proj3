But then a new hero arrives, a half gnome half human. He looks weird but he has all the good traits of a gnome
and all the good traits of a human. Meaning he is fast and nimble but also, do not get distracted easily.
His only disadvantage is that, he got very short arms, or should I say he got T-rex arms. His reach is so short that it is 
very difficult for him to feed himself or even hold a sword to fight the trolls.
